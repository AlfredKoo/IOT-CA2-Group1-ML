3 functions inside:
model_functions.create_new_training_dataframe()
model_functions.training(modelselection) #Training reads from a csv file in label and datasets accordingly
					 #Creates the model for prediction
model_functions.prediction(modelselection,dataset) #Choose model to predict

modelselection options:
SGDClassifier
SGDClassifier_scaled
LogisticRegressor
LogisticRegressor_scaled
KNNClassifier
KNNClassifier_scaled
RandomForest
RandomForest_scaled

Note: For the final implentation, feature engineering of dataset was scrapped
due to false positives.
